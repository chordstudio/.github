# Chord

Chord is a music-based matching platform focused on helping people connect through what they actually listen to.

## What We’re Building

Our work centers around a few key areas:

- A matching system that uses real listening patterns.
- A clean, modern web experience for discovering people through music.
- Integrations with major music platforms.
- Internal services that support user data, matching logic, and platform reliability.

We keep our engineering approach simple: predictable structure, readable code, and making sure everything we build is maintainable over time.

## Open Source

As Chord evolves, we plan to open-source selected components — including some internal tools, matching engines and much more so that parts of the platform can be useful to the wider developer community.

## Contributing

External contributions will be supported later.
